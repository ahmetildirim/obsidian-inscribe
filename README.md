# Obsidian Inscribe Plugin

Inscribe is an AI-powered inline autocompletion plugin for Obsidian. It enhances your writing experience by providing smart, contextual suggestions as you type.

## What Inscribe Does

Inscribe works quietly in the background as you write, offering intelligent completions that match your writing style and context. After you type a space, the plugin can suggest natural continuations of your text, helping you write more efficiently while maintaining your unique voice.

- **Multiple AI Provider Support**:
  - OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
  - Ollama (local models like Llama3, Mistral, Gemma)
  - OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Customizable Profiles**: Create different completion profiles for various writing styles and needs
- **Per-Path Configuration**: Set different profiles for different folders in your vault
- **Adjustable Parameters**:
  - Customize temperature to control creativity level
  - Fine-tune delay settings
  - Edit system and user prompts
- **Status Bar Integration**: Easily see and control the plugin status

2. **Configuration**:
   - Go to Settings → Inscribe
   - Enable the plugin and configure at least one AI provider
   - Set up your API keys or connection details for your chosen provider(s)
3. **Create Profiles** (optional):
   - Create different profiles with specific AI models and settings
   - Assign profiles to specific paths in your vault
4. **Start Writing**:
   - Begin typing in any note
   - After typing a space, the plugin will suggest completions
   - Press Tab to accept a suggestion or continue typing to ignore it
5. **Toggle On/Off**:
   - Use the status bar icon to quickly enable/disable completions
   - Configure path-specific settings to control where completions appear
